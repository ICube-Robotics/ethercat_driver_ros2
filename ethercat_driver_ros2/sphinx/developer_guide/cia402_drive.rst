CANopen over EtherCAT for electrical drives
===========================================

CANopen also defines several device profiles by establishing standard behavior and communication objects for similar devices. In the case of electrical drives, the profile is given by the **CiA402** ("CANopen device profile for drives and motion control") norm compliant with the `IEC <https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/23757>`_ standard that defines programming languages for programmable control systems. The CiA402 norm specifies specific objects in OD in range :code:`0x6000` to :code:`0x67fe`, what guarantees, that for a drive compatible with CiA402, typical process values such as position, velocity, or torque set-points and actual values will always be defined in the same objects with the same address regardless of the manufacturer and by such simplifies the commissioning of different drives. CIA402 also defines a state machine that corresponds to the driveâ€™s actual operating state (:code:`Disabled`, :code:`Fault`, :code:`Switch ON`, etc.). This state machine is controlled and monitored by two mandatory PDO entries: :code:`Control Word` and :code:`Status Word`. The drive cannot be started until the state machine has been put into the appropriate state.

The device states and possible control sequences of the drive are described by the CANopen state machine as follows:

The possible drive states are :

  :widths: 15 35
  :header-rows: 1

  * - State
    - Description
  * - :code:`NOT_READY_TO_SWITCH_ON`
    - The drive is not ready to switch on. The drive is in boot phase. Drive motion functions are disabled. No communication established.
  * - :code:`SWITCH_ON_DISABLED`
    - The drive cannot be enabled via the EtherCAT interface. Drive motion functions are disabled.
  * - :code:`READY_TO_SWITCH_ON`
    - The drive can be enabled. Parameters can be transferred. Power may be applied. Drive motion functions are disabled.
  * - :code:`SWITCHED_ON`
    - The drive is enabled but idle No fault detected. Power is enabled Drive motion functions are disabled. Parameters can be transferred. No set-points are transferred from the EtherCAT interface.
  * - :code:`OPERATION_ENABLED`
    - Normal operation mode No fault detected. Drive motion functions and power are enabled. Power enabled. Set-points are transferred from the EtherCAT interface.
  * - :code:`QUICK_STOP_ACTIVE`
    - The quick stop process is executed. Drive motion functions are disabled.  Power is enabled.
  * - :code:`FAULT_REACTION_ACTIVE`
    - A fault has occurred, fault reaction processes are executed.
  * - :code:`FAULT`
    - A fault is active, Drive is stopped and its functions are disabled.

State transitions are the result of events that can be either internal or triggers through the :code:`Control Word`. When a command trigger for state change is received, the transition is performed before any other command is processed.

The possible transition states, their trigger events and performed actions are :

CANopen uses 16-bits :code:`Status Word` and :code:`Control Word` to monitor and control the state machine. These PDO entries have the following bit assignment :

The :code:`Status Word` is only updated and written by the drive in :code:`Safe-Op` and :code:`Operational` states. The current drive state can be decoded from the logical combination of the bits in the :code:`Status Word`:
